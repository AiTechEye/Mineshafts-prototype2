this is a Godot game project: https://godotengine.org  
Version 1: https://github.com/AiTechEye/Godot-Voxel-Prototype

This was meant to be a personal project, with a full game as goal, but got a spoke in the wheel.
So instead of deleting the whole project i uploaded it here, so you all can enjoy it :)

This is a voxel based game prototype, physic items and even a basic realtime node-based modeditor
